* This app can be useful for people who want to know more about VJTI through its events and clubs. 
* The grade lists which are send on WhatsApp groups, gets misplaced sometimes or sometimes students can't find it. So for that we have made a separate section for uploading grades in all years and in all branches . So the teacher can upload the grades directly on the app which will make it easier for students since there would be a grade list for each subject at one place.
* Timetables and syllabus are downloadable so the students can view it whenever they want and they don't have go through their WhatsApp pdfs to search for timetable or syllabus.
* Students hesitating to ask doubts to teachers in class can ask here in the chatroom. Also we have provided option to upload assignments and study materials so that everything is in one place.
* CGPA calculator will be very useful for students to calculate their pointers and also save that for respective semesters making it easy to have all the pointers of all semester at one place.
* Application of E-resources is to make book pdfs and past year question papers available for students to study and refer during their exams. Each year have their own E-resources page where they can get and upload pdfs and question papers.

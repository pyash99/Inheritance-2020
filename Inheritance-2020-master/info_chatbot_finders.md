## Description
In this project, we had made a website consisting of chatbot functioning.

this chatbot model is based on the web scrapping. whatever the question we give to the chatbot, the chatbot does a google search based on the topic.

```
        from googlesearch import search
        search_result_list = list(search(question, tld="co.in",start=0,num=10, stop=10, pause=2))
```

after doing google search the bot will pickup the first hyperlink.extract the whole text and do the natural language processing it and display the appropriate result based on it.
```     #getting page of particular hyperlink. here index means hyperlink number
        page = requests.get(search_result_list[index])
        tree = html.fromstring(page.content)
        #prints the whole .html script
        soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, features="lxml")
        
        article_text = ''
        article = soup.findAll('p')
        
        for element in article:
            article_text += '\n' + ''.join(element.findAll(text = True))
        first_sentence = article_text.split('\n')
        #first_sentence consist of list of text of the webpage seprated by newline.
```

we had also embedded some greeting syntax file which will deal with some greeting and natural conversation questions like who are you? , tell me a joke, etc.
```
        def filter(question):
            # path1 is the address of greeting.yml file which consist of all the greeting syntax.
            a_yaml_file = open(path1)
            par = yaml.load(a_yaml_file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
```
so, the model will first check if the entered question is greeting type or not. if the question is not greeting type then it will show result according to web scrapping

## Applications

* This project can help in finding the main solution to many questions. so instead of surfing over the internet, enter your question here and get the answer.

## Future scope
>This project can build further by implementing a voice search in it. Also, the model can be modified so as to get a more effective and accurate answer
